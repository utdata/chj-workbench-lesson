# Introduction to Workbench

This is a lesson designed for the Center for Health Journalism Data Fellowship program. The aim is to provide an introduction to [Workbench](https://workbenchdata.com/), a web-based tool that uses Python's [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis library under the hood.

The tool provides some of the benefits of programming-based data science techniques, like repeatable code with annotations to explain the steps, but in an approachable manner using a web-based interface and minimal programming. It allows the user to concentrate on the technique and not the programming syntax.

I have a series of short video tutorials on the [Basic Functions of Data Journalism](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7320305) that you may find useful. The video covers some common techniques used in data analysis, including those used in Workbench.

## How we'll handle this

- I'll do a quick demonstration working through some of the relevant functions and abilities of Workbench. Just watch this part ... don't try to follow along. You'll get to do that soon enough.
- We'll work together on a project step-by-step so you can practice this.
- I'll provide a detailed practice session you can do on your own later.
